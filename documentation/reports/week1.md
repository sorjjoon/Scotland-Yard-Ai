### Weekly report 1. (16.3-20.3)

Researched and picked a topic for the project. 
So far the only progress made was creating an empty repository and laying out simple goals for the project.

I researched numerous algorithms until finally settling on Monte Carlo tree search for the project.

For the moment everything seems clear, though I was not sure how comprehensive the project requirments had to be, because for instance at the moment I'm not sure on the time complexity of MCTS, or if I'll need any complex data structures (such as a hashmap) to fully implement it.

The goal for next week is to create a functional version of Scotland Yard (as well as the gui for displaying a game).

Time spent this week on the project ~1h (excluding time spent researching before settling on a subject)
